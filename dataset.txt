--- PREAMBLE & PURPOSE ---
---
This Global Operations & Policy Manual (GOPM) serves as the central source of truth for all OmniCorp employees worldwide. It is a living document intended to outline our operational procedures, employment policies, company values, and the systems we use to achieve our mission. This manual is not an employment contract but a guide to ensure consistency, fairness, and efficiency across the organization. All employees are expected to familiarize themselves with its contents and adhere to the policies herein. For any clarifications, please file a ticket with the relevant department via the 'Helios' internal portal.

==        SECTION 1: COMPANY CULTURE & CONDUCT         ==
=========================================================

---
--- 1.1: Our Mission & Core Values ---
---
OmniCorp's mission is to "Pioneer scalable solutions that connect the world." This is guided by our four core values, The "4 C's":
1.  **Customer-Centricity:** We place the customer at the heart of every decision, product, and interaction.
2.  **Courageous Innovation:** We take calculated risks and are not afraid to challenge the status quo to find better ways.
3.  **Candid Collaboration:** We communicate with transparency, honesty, and respect, even when it's difficult.
4.  **Complete Ownership:** We are accountable for our actions and their outcomes, from the initial concept to the final result.

---
--- 1.2: Code of Professional Conduct ---
---
All employees must maintain the highest standards of professional and ethical conduct. This includes, but is not limited to:
-   Treating all colleagues, clients, and partners with respect.
-   Upholding OmniCorp's commitment to a harassment-free and discrimination-free workplace.
-   Maintaining the confidentiality of proprietary company information, client data, and employee records.
-   Avoiding any conflicts of interest, real or perceived. Any potential conflict must be disclosed to your manager and the People & Culture department immediately.

Violations of the Code of Conduct can lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

---
--- 2.1: Work Hours & Remote Work Framework ---
---
OmniCorp operates on a Hybrid "Flex-Work" Model.
-   **Core Collaboration Hours:** All employees, regardless of location, are expected to be available for synchronous communication and meetings between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM in their primary team's time zone (e.g., 10 AM - 4 PM PST for US West Coast teams).
-   **On-Site & Remote Days:** Employees designated as "Hybrid" are expected to be in their assigned office a minimum of two (2) designated "anchor days" per week, typically Tuesday and Thursday, to foster in-person collaboration. Employees designated as "Fully Remote" are not required to come into an office but may be required to travel for quarterly team meetings.
-   **Time Tracking:** All non-exempt (hourly) employees are required to accurately log their work hours daily using the "Chronos" timekeeping system, accessible via the employee dashboard.

---
--- 2.2: Compensation & Performance ---
---
-   **Pay Schedule:** Salaries are paid bi-weekly on the 15th and the last business day of each month via direct deposit.
-   **The Ascent Program (Performance Reviews):** Performance reviews are conducted semi-annually. The "Mid-Year Check-in" occurs in June, and the "End-of-Year Impact Review" occurs in December. Goals are set and tracked in our HRIS, "Workday."
-   **Bonuses:** Annual performance bonuses are discretionary and based on a combination of company performance, departmental success, and individual contributions as measured in the Ascent Program. They are not guaranteed.

Our customer relationship is our most valuable asset. The following protocols are managed within our CRM (**Salesforce**) and support platform (**Zendesk**).

-   **How to Process a Refund:**
    1.  Verify eligibility in Salesforce by checking the 'Initial Subscription Date'.
    2.  Confirm with the customer via a standardized Zendesk macro that they understand the refund will result in immediate termination of service.
    3.  Process the refund in the Stripe payment gateway.
    4.  Log the action in Salesforce on the customer's account page with the reason code "30-Day Guarantee."
-   **Prorated Refunds for Cancellations:** We **do not** offer prorated refunds for mid-cycle cancellations. A customer's service will remain active until the end of their paid billing period.
-   **Exceptions:** Any exception to this refund policy (e.g., for a prolonged service outage) requires written approval from a Director of Customer Success. The approval email must be attached to the Salesforce case.
